About
-----
Modeful attempts to bring the power of modal editing to diagram software.
Once you've felt the power of vim_, or emacs_, you sometimes wish more 
software would focus on power users. Enable them to create, modify and 
navigate swiftly, without leaving home row.

Modeful is focused on power users. The current state is a more of a proof
of concept to show that modal editing indeed does work for diagram creation.

The first version of modeful is built using on Kivy_. It's a fantastic
framework to create quick proof of concepts. If things get more serious
a rewrite might be needed in a compiled language (C++/C#/...), we'll see...
